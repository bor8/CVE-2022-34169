Don't get confused with the error codes. They are the other way round. The Fix https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/41ef2b249073450172e11163a4d05762364b1297?diff=unified#diff-3d2cb29a8f3fca8e2f3421d2898dce63255b850406456533cce91f26dbf8dbe2R217 throws an error with error code 1 and thus catches the security risk. If the fix is not present, the source code runs through without error with error code 0 - but too many elements are created in the object!

* Error code 1 is good! :)
* Error code 0 is bad! :(
